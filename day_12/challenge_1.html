CHALLENGE 1: Module Master
Solve yesterday's Challenge 2 (the Pokemon API with async & await) but refactor the code so that you have separate files for each of these things:
- getting data from the Pokemon API
- creating and adding HTML elements to the webpage 
Your webpage should be able to call functions from those files to keep everything working normally.
