CHALLENGE 8: Rock Paper Scissors
​
Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) is an age-old game that has been entertaining youths and adults alike for centuries.
Look up the rules of RPS if you don't know them already! 
​
8.1 - Core gameplay
Make a RPS game where a user can battle a computer. 
Prompt the user to choose between "scissors", "paper" and "rock". 
If their decision is not valid, let them know and ask them again. 
If their user is valid, let them know, and use a random number to generate the computers choice.
Print the result of the match according the RPS rules (google it if needed).
​
Use functions appropriately to keep the code organized.
​
8.2 - Repeating Game
At the end of the game, ask the user if they would like another game. If they say yes, use recursion to run the method again. 
​
8.3 - Keeping Score
See if you can implement a way of keeping track of the score, and printing it at the end of each match
​
8.4 - Match History
Use objects to represent the game & the players if you aren't already.
At the start of matches, prompt to put in a name for the player.
A match object should contain properties for a winner name, and for 2 player objects.
When a match is finished, the winner name should be set to either the player name, or the word "CPU" if the computer won.
Store the match object in an array once the match is finished.
When repeating the game, display a count for the amount of matches that the player has won & for the amount of matches that the CPU has won.
