CHALLENGE 2: Fruit Classes & Objects
Object instantiation is an incredibly powerful feature. 
If you think of fruit as a class, then an item such as an apple will only have a certain number of bites to it.

Create an object from a class named Fruit. 
Update a global variable in the Fruit class that keeps a list of all Fruit in existence - put the newly-created fruit object in that list.
When the object is instantiated from the class, set 3 properties on it (name, colour, bites). 
Also create a function in the class that when called, takes a bite of the fruit and decrements the bites property.
If there are no bites left:
    - remove the fruit object from the global Fruits list
    - log that the Fruit has been completely eaten
If the fruit's bites value is greater than 0:
    - log that the Fruit was delicious, and has ${bites} number of bites left
