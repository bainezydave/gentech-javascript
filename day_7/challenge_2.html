<!-- /*
CHALLENGE 2: Random User Data Fetcher 
Sometime we need random user data in our app. There's an app for that! https://randomuser.me
Build on the provided HTML below.
Examine the code. Think about what might happen when you run the file.
Run the code in your browser. With console open, refresh and you should see a response object after a second or two.
Examine the response object in console, find the property which contains the response JSON.
Update your console.log to log only the response JSON, not the entire object.
Create a new function: parseRandomUser
Update your code to use a callback i.e. pass getRandomUser the parseRandomUser function.
Your goal is to get parseRandomUser logging the random user details.
Read about error-first callbacks. Can you implement error handling? The Random User request might not always respond the way we expect.
Beast Mode
Display random user details in the browser
Add a button to grab a new random user

And yes, this is using XMLHttpRequest -- you might have to read some documentation on this one.
