<!-- /*
CHALLENGE 4: Error Handling 
Make sure you have either Challenge 1 or Challenge 3 completed, as you can use one of those as 
a starting point for this challenge. 

Add error handling to your API requests. 
Using try-catch, throw, and switch-case statements, you should be able to log a 
message detailing what error has occured.
For example, if the data from the API request is actually a 404 Not Found or 403 
Forbidden error, you should be able to log that and not add the data to the Pokemon or Jokes array.

You could solve this in a few ways - using try-catch & throw, or using AJAX's built-in error handling. 
Try AJAX first - read the docs!
