// CHALLENGE 6 - Pokemon Rare Candy Dispenser
// You have your very own Pokemon - a Pikachu!
// You're also super rich and have purchased a heap of Rare Candy - special items that can improve a Pokemon's power.

// 6.1 Core Functionality
// Create an object variable called "pikachu" with properties for nickname, level, HP, attack, defence, special attack, special defence & speed.
// Nickname should equal Pikachu for now.
// Create a variable that keeps track of how many "rare candies" you have.
// If the rare candy count is higher than 0, ask the user if they would like to level up their Pikachu.
// When the Pikachu levels up, increase the level by 1. Increase HP, attack, defence, special attack, special defense, and speed by 10% of their current values.

// 6.2 User-Controlled Candy Count
// Instead of just spending 1 Rare Candy, ask the user how many they would like to spend and spend that number of Rare Candy on Pikachu.
// To make the level-up process easy & still work, you may have to put it into a loop that runs a number of iterations equal to the amount of candy you spent.

// 6.3 Nicknaming
// Allow the user to set a new nickname for their Pokemon.
// This may mean you have to build a menu system so the user can choose if they're levelling up or nicknaming their Pokemon.
// When presenting the menu to the user, print the Pokemon's nickname in the menu too.
