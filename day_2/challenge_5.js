// CHALLENGE 5 - Banking App
// We can make decisions in our code by using If, Elsif, Else blocks.

// 5.1 Bank Base Functionality

// * A user's initial balance is 0.0.
// * Display the user's balance.
// * Ask the user what they would like to do.
// * If they type "balance", display their balance.
// * If the user types anything other than "balance", display the message "Invalid selection!".

// 5.2 - Deposit Functionality

// * Add "deposit" as a program option.
// * If the user types "deposit", ask the user for the deposit amount and then add this to the user's current balance.

// 5.3 - Withdraw Functionality
// * Add "withdraw" as a program option.
// * If the user types "withdraw", ask the user for the withdrawal amount and then deduct this from the user's current balance.
// * Note: The user should not be allowed to withdraw more than their current balance!

// 5.4 - Looping Functionality
// * Enclose the program statements in a loop to allow the program to repeat until the user chooses to exit the program.
