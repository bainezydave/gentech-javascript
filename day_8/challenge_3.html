CHALLENGE 3: Promise Chain Chomp 

    Ever played Super Mario 64 and seen a big barking ball full of razor-sharp teeth? That's a Chain Chomp! 
    Chain Chomps bounce and bounce and bounce all day. 
    If they see Mario, they bounce 3 more times, then leap towards Mario. 
    
    This challenge is all about using a promise, chain some ".then" statements together with some good functions & arguments/parameters.
    Ideally your code should be DRY - you might have a function for bouncing, leaping, barking, and some promises to call more functions when functions have finished processing.
    So, some behaviours to think of for your promises:

    Chain Chomp idle:
        - bounce 10 times with 1 second between bounces

    Chain Chomp chase:
        - bounce 3 times with 0.5 seconds between bounces
        - leap 1 time immediately
    
    At the end of all behaviours:
        - bark 2 times with 0.5 seconds between barks 

    When you run your code, it should randomly pick between the idle & the chase behaviours and follow those steps in promises.

    (And yes, this might not be the most efficient way to write a Chain Chomp's behaviours. But it's a fun way to learn about promise-then chaining!)
