CHALLENGE 4: NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day API

This is getting towards editing content on the webpage - don't worry about this unless you're really looking for things to do.
We'll cover this sort of content as a class next week!

4.1 - Core Functionality: 
Go to the NASA API website here: https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod
Do whatever needs to be done to get an API key (usually make an account or enter your email address somewhere).
Store that API key somewhere handy.

In a HTML file, write some code that will grab the current photo from the APOD API and set it as the page's background. 

4.2 - More Data!:
Use at least 3 of the other NASA APIs to show some cool space data on the web page as well.
Showing data on top of a photo will probably require some decent CSS styling so it's all readable - brush up on your CSS!

4.3 - More Photos!:
Use the NASA Image & Video Library API and the NASA Mars Rover Photos API to pull a new image and set it as the background of the page when the user clicks on a button on the page.
APIs are here:
- https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images 
- https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos

Use a Promise race here - you should call both APIs and only use the first image that comes back.
